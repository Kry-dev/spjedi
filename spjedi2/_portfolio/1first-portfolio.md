summary: A Superior Design to E-Commerce Clothing...
---

We have always loved beautiful clothing, shoes and of course accessories. As long as we can remember, we have been exploring new ways of dressing, new materials, colours and textures. Although we travelled the world in our search, we had trouble finding products that were just right. After years of not being entirely happy with what we could buy, we decided to create our own products that fulfilled all the requirements we had. Viola Milano came to be after a number of inspirational journeys through southern Europe and Italy in particular.

The site was designed with a simple, yet sophisticated structure. We adopted the foundation as it was not tied to seasonal colors, outdated design, or unmanageable layout. Our process is the same with every site, keep it classy and allow room to grow. The project took just over 2 months.
