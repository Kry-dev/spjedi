SharePoint 365 has come a long way from it's start in 2010. Most people resisting have held on to two keys reservations:

## Is my content REALLY safe?

Microsoft secures your data with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128bit or AES 256bit encryption on servers that hold all messaging data including emails and IM conversations, content stored in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. Thhe Microsoft 365 security strategy is built on four pillars:

#### 1. Prevent Breach 
            -live site penetration testing
            -multi-factor authentication
            -perimeter vulnerability scanning

#### 2. Detect Breach
            -security alerts
            -external signals
            -incorporate new patterns to trigger alerts

##### 3. Respond to Breach
            -ability to deny or stop access to sensitive data
            -diligent incident response process

##### 4. Recover from Breach
            -ability to change the security principals
            -automatically update the affected systems
            -audit the state of the deployment to identify any anomalies

#####  What about hybrid connections to your local environment?
To successfully access your local network the takedown of Office 365 and then the takedown of your local firewall. Hybrid connections can only go through one port and it is recommended that you only make one way connection to Office 365 to avoid such an attack.
