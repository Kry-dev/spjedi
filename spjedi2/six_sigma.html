				<h3>Hidden Factories Exist</h3><strong>Our average decrease of steps is 18-23% by automation and removal of redundant steps. Multiple examples of our work is available upon request.</strong>
				<p>Pockets of inefficiencies exist. A clear example of where Six Sigma could benefit is the following:</p>
                <p>In a paperclip factory a foreman watches over the process and notices that every 100th paperclip has an imperfection. He takes that paperclip and throws it back in the fire to be remade while never reporting to upper management. A rolling problem occurs as the manufacturing cost grow to be higher and output becomes lower. </p>
				<p>Problems like this occur every day in all organizations. SP Jedi helps to document the current process that is being utilized and provide recommendations on the future flow. We help get companies back on the right track by showing on the steps. We have Six-Sigma Certified Partners on our team to help each step of the way. </p>

Just an in marriage, the external parties can see the cracks of the internal parties by almost any interaction. Companies rely on sustainability and customer gravitate to the ones that practice what they preach. </p>
